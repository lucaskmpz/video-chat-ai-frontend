# Chat with Video Application

The Chat with Video application is a user-friendly platform that allows you to upload a video file and prompt an artificial intelligence (AI) model to generate text-based responses based on the content of the video. This unique combination of video and text-based chat provides an innovative way to interact with AI, making it possible to extract information, insights, or even creative responses from video content.

## Technologies Used

This application leverages a variety of technologies to provide a seamless user experience:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines UI development with a focus on utility classes.
- **Radix UI**: A set of low-level UI primitives for React that helps create accessible and composable UI components.
- **Shadcn UI**: A custom UI component library that extends Tailwind CSS with additional components and functionality.

By combining the power of Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Shadcn UI, the application offers a highly customizable and visually appealing interface while maintaining accessibility and user-friendly functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using the Chat with Video application, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

- **Backend Service**: The application assumes you have a corresponding backend service in place to handle video processing and AI interactions. This readme focuses on the frontend components.

## Usage

To use the Chat with Video application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo.git
   cd your-frontend-repo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Configure the frontend to communicate with your backend service. Ensure that the API endpoints and any necessary environment variables are correctly set to interact with your backend.

4. **Start the Application**: Start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will now be able to use the Chat with Video application.

## How It Works

The Chat with Video application seamlessly integrates video content with text-based AI interactions:

1. **Video Upload**: Users can upload a video file in MP4 format using the "Select a video" button. The selected video serves as the source for AI-based responses.

2. **Transcription Prompt**: Users enter keywords or prompts in the "Transcription prompt" field. These prompts guide the AI model in generating text-based responses based on the video content. The special variable `{transcription}` can be used in prompts to include the video's transcription in the responses.

3. **Prompt and Model Selection**: Users can select predefined prompts and AI models from the dropdown menus. This allows users to customize the AI interaction to suit their needs.

4. **Temperature Control**: The application offers a temperature slider that users can adjust. Higher values result in less precise but potentially more creative AI-generated responses.

5. **Transcription Generation**: Clicking the "Run" button triggers a request to the backend service. The backend utilizes OpenAI or a similar transcription model to process the video and generate text-based responses based on the provided prompts.

6. **Display Transcription**: The generated transcription is displayed in the "Result generated by the AI..." text area. Users can review and utilize the AI-generated text as needed.

7. **Customization**: The application is highly customizable. You can modify the UI, integrate additional features, or enhance functionality to meet your specific project requirements.

By combining the strengths of Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Shadcn UI, this application provides a responsive and accessible interface for seamless interactions between users, video content, and AI-generated responses. It offers a flexible and engaging way to extract valuable information from video content while allowing for easy customization and extension of functionality to suit diverse use cases.
